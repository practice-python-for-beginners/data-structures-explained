# Data Structures Explained

Welcome to **data-structures-explained**, part of the [practice-python-for-beginners](https://github.com/practice-python-for-beginners) series.

This repository introduces Python’s core **collection data types**: `list`, `tuple`, `set`, and `dict`.  
These are essential for organizing and managing data effectively in real-world Python programs.

---

## 📦 Repository: `data-structures-explained`

**Purpose:**  
Introduce beginners to Python’s fundamental data structures — how to create, modify, and use **lists**, **tuples**, **sets**, and **dictionaries** for practical programming tasks.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Creating and modifying **lists**
- Using **tuples** for immutable collections
- Storing unique items in **sets**
- Managing key-value pairs in **dictionaries**
- Common built-in methods and best practices
